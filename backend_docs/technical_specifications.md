# DoD Fitness App Backend Service - Technical Specifications

## Programming Language and Framework

- Language: TypeScript
- Framework: NestJS
  - Rationale: NestJS provides a robust, scalable architecture with built-in support for TypeScript, dependency injection, and modular development.

## Database

- Primary Database: PostgreSQL
  - Rationale: PostgreSQL offers robust ACID compliance, excellent performance, and advanced features like JSON support.
- Caching Layer: Redis
  - Rationale: Redis provides high-performance caching to reduce database load and improve response times.

## ORM

- TypeORM
  - Rationale: TypeORM integrates well with TypeScript and NestJS, providing type-safe database operations.

## API

- RESTful API following OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification
- JSON as the primary data exchange format

## Authentication and Authorization

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization

## External Services Integration

- OpenAI GPT API for generating personalized workout and nutrition plans
- Integration framework: Axios for HTTP requests

## Testing

- Unit Testing: Jest
- E2E Testing: Supertest
- API Testing: Postman/Newman

## Code Quality and Style

- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks

## Documentation

- API Documentation: Swagger UI (integrated with NestJS)
- Code Documentation: TypeDoc

## Monitoring and Logging

- Logging: Winston
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

## Containerization and Orchestration

- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling

## CI/CD

- GitLab CI/CD for automated testing, building, and deployment

## Security

- Helmet.js for HTTP header security
- bcrypt for password hashing
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications

## Performance Optimization

- Compression: Use compression middleware for response compression
- Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Scalability

- Horizontal scaling through Kubernetes
- Database read replicas for scaling read operations

## Version Control

- Git with GitFlow branching model

## Package Management

- npm for package management

## Environment Management

- dotenv for environment variable management

## File Storage

- Amazon S3 or equivalent for storing user-uploaded files (e.g., profile pictures)

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

- Regular automated backups of the database
- Multi-region deployment for high availability and disaster recovery

These technical specifications provide a solid foundation for building a robust, scalable, and maintainable backend service for the DoD Fitness App. The chosen technologies and tools are industry-standard and well-suited for developing secure and high-performance applications. As the project evolves, these specifications may be reviewed and updated to meet changing requirements or to incorporate new technologies.
